      If you regularly take notes, with this app, you can organise them by creating cross-references
      and adding tags. Of particular note is the ability to combine multiple messages into one. This
      is a feature that I have missed in many note-taking apps. You can see that the developers have
      thought everything through to the last detail. It is a nice touch.
